## Photometry Materials

This repository contains the following materials:

1. **Notebook: `photometry.ipynb`** (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qYafR1xzluWYCwNFQIOhMqEnFFaLrYQQ?usp=sharing)
   - This Jupyter Notebook provides step-by-step instructions and code examples for performing aperture photometry on astronomical data using Python. Follow along with the notebook to learn the basics of aperture photometry.

2. **Astronomical Image (FITS File): `carina_sci.fits`**
   - The FITS file contains sample astronomical image data that we'll use for the photometric analysis. You can use this file to practice the techniques discussed in the workshop.
