# Data Analysis Workshop: Introduction to Aperture Photometry

Welcome to the "Introduction to Aperture Photometry" workshop repository! In this workshop, we will explore the fundamental concepts of aperture photometry in astronomical data analysis.

## Workshop Materials

This repository contains the following materials:

1. **Notebook: `photometry.ipynb`**
   - This Jupyter Notebook provides step-by-step instructions and code examples for performing aperture photometry on astronomical data using Python. Follow along with the notebook to learn the basics of aperture photometry.

2. **Astronomical Image (FITS File): `carina_sci.fits`**
   - The FITS file contains sample astronomical image data that we'll use for the photometric analysis. You can use this file to practice the techniques discussed in the workshop.
   - [Download Large FITS File](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_Cm1B82WMI48rRnZtDzAllkH0fU5n7og/view?usp=sharing)


3. **Presentation Slides: `PHOTOMETRY.pdf`**
   - The PowerPoint presentation slides used during the workshop are included for your reference. These slides provide an overview of the key concepts and methods covered in the workshop.
